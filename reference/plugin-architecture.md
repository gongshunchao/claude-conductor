## Skills

### context-awareness

**Auto-discovers** when `conductor/` directory exists.

```yaml
---
name: conductor-context
description: Auto-load Conductor project context when conductor/ directory exists. Use for any development task in a Conductor-managed project.
allowed-tools: Read, Glob
---

# Conductor Context Awareness

When you detect a `conductor/` directory, automatically consider:

1. `conductor/product.md` - What we're building
2. `conductor/tech-stack.md` - Technologies in use
3. `conductor/workflow.md` - Development methodology
4. `conductor/tracks.md` - Current project status

## Key Context Points

- **Coverage Target**: From workflow.md
- **Commit Strategy**: From workflow.md
- **Style Guides**: From conductor/code_styleguides/
```

### tdd-workflow

**Auto-discovers** when working on implementation tasks.

```yaml
---
name: tdd-workflow
description: Test-Driven Development guidance. Use when writing code, implementing features, or fixing bugs in projects that follow TDD methodology.
---
# TDD Workflow Skill

## The TDD Cycle

### 1. Red Phase
- Write a failing test FIRST
- Run tests, confirm FAILURE

### 2. Green Phase
- Write MINIMUM code to pass
- Run tests, confirm PASS

### 3. Refactor Phase
- Clean up while tests pass
- Run tests after each change
```

### code-styleguides

**Auto-discovers** when writing code in specific languages. Reads styleguides from `conductor/code_styleguides/` in the project.

```yaml
---
name: code-styleguides
description: Language-specific code style guidelines. Use when writing TypeScript, Python, Go, JavaScript, or HTML/CSS code.
---
# Code Style Guides

Reads from conductor/code_styleguides/ which are copied during /conductor:setup.
See templates/code-styleguides/ for available language styleguides.
```

## Hooks

**`hooks/hooks.json`**

```json
{
  "SessionStart": [
    {
      "matcher": "startup|resume",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "if [ -d conductor ] && [ -f conductor/tracks.md ]; then in_progress=$(grep -c '\\[~\\]' conductor/tracks.md 2>/dev/null || echo 0); pending=$(grep -c '\\[ \\]' conductor/tracks.md 2>/dev/null || echo 0); echo \"{\\\"systemMessage\\\": \\\"Conductor: ${in_progress} in-progress, ${pending} pending tracks\\\"}\"; fi",
          "timeout": 5
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "PostToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Write|Edit",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // empty' | { read fp; if echo \"$fp\" | grep -q 'conductor/tracks/.*/plan.md'; then echo 'Plan updated'; fi; }",
          "timeout": 5
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Stop": [
    {
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "if [ -f conductor/tracks.md ] && grep -q '\\[~\\]' conductor/tracks.md 2>/dev/null; then echo '{\"systemMessage\": \"Reminder: You have in-progress tracks. Run /conductor:status for details.\"}'; fi",
          "timeout": 5
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Hook Purposes

| Event          | Purpose                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `SessionStart` | Show track count on session start |
| `PostToolUse`  | Detect plan.md modifications      |
| `Stop`         | Remind about in-progress work     |

## Templates

Templates are copied during `/conductor:setup`:

### workflow.md

- Guiding principles
- Task lifecycle (TDD)
- Phase completion protocol
- Quality gates
- Commit guidelines

### product.md

- Product vision
- Target users
- Goals and features
- Success metrics

### product-guidelines.md

- Brand voice
- Design standards
- Communication style

## Environment Variables

Plugins can use these variables:

| Variable                | Description                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | Absolute path to plugin directory |
| `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` | Project root directory            |

Example in hooks:

```json
{
  "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate.sh"
}
```

## Installation

### User-wide (recommended)

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["https://github.com/yourname/conductor-claude"]
}
```

### Project-specific

Add to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["./path/to/conductor-claude"]
}
```

## Namespacing

All commands are namespaced with the plugin name:

- `/conductor:setup`
- `/conductor:newTrack`
- `/conductor:implement`
- `/conductor:status`
- `/conductor:revert`

This prevents conflicts with other plugins.
